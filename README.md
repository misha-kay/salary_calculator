# Python Salary Calculator

This was my final project as part of Women in Tech Python course with PA Consulting, of which I won the first place prize.

This is a UK salary calculator, written in Python, which includes a testing file to check various use cases.
The program prompts the user to provide an annual salary, tax code, pension type, pension percentage and student loan type; then uses a combination of logic and mathematics to calculate Income Tax, National Insurance Contributions, Pension and Student Loan from a user's payslip.

_Note: The figures returned by this program are relevant as of the UK tax year 2023/24._
